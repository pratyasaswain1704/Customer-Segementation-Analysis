# Customer-Segementation-Analysis
This project explores natural behavioral structure within mall customer data through clustering techniques. Instead of relying on predefined categories, the analysis identifies segments that emerge directly from similarities in age, income, and spending intensity.

Clustering quality metrics — including inertia, silhouette score, and Calinski–Harabasz index — consistently highlight a six-segment configuration. A dedicated stability check confirms that this structure is robust, repeatable, and not driven by random initialization.

Each segment is examined numerically and visually to reveal differences in spending behavior, demographic attributes, and income levels, forming a clear behavioral map of the customer population.

The dataset includes 200 customers described by:

Gender
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1–100)
